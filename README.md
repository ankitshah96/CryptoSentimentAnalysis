# Choice of Sentimemnt Analysis approach

1. Pre-Processing:

   A. Removal of white spaces.Here I have not converted text to lowercase as case of the text can convey emphasis information.
      Next step was to consider only those messages referring to DOGE or SHIB coins.
      
   B. Furthermore, messages were tokenized, stemmed (representing words in their root form) and lemmatized (representing related words in dictionary). 
      Only english language messages were considered, rest messages were removed.
      
2. Sentiment Analysis:
   I decided to use VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner) for sentiment analysis. VADER is a lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool, specifically 
   attuned to sentiments expressed in social media.
   It works well sentiment of a text containing emoticons, slangs, conjunctions, capital words and punctuations. Vader is part of NLTK library.
